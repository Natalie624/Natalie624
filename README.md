### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Natalie, an seasoned technical program manager who sometimes likes to code. I generally enjoy building websites and leading teams in enterprise web
implementations using modern tools and technologies. I'm currently learning more about generative AI, machine learning and how it enhances the productivity
of agile software projects. This has led me to dabble a bit in Python and try out creating my own GPT. I have been working with and managing software teams 
that successfully produce high quality, user-centered products for nearly two decades.  
Here are a few of my side-projects that keep me busy when I have down-time (some public some not). 
 

Connect with me: &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliecervantes/"><img height="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Natalie624/Natalie624/main/images/linkedin.png?raw=true"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Fun Fact: I've lived in 4 different countries. I last spent several years at the southern tip of Baja California, Mexico trying to speak better Spanish than my last name would indicate that I do!
