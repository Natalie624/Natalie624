### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Natalie, a girly-girl who also likes to code. I'm partial to creating awesome websites and love working with Jamstack architecture. Netlify and Gatsby are my jam and Contentful is my go-to headless CMS of choice. I'm still a bit of newbie when it comes to getting my feet wet in the depths of programming but I have been working with software teams and managing software product roll-outs for years! So its about time I start coding stuff myself, I'd say! Here are a few of my projects - some while working with First String Digital. I'm working up the courage and confidece to start contributing to the lovely open-source community that has been my savior on more than one occasion. Feel free to reach out to me with questions, collaborations, or anything else tech related. 

Fun Fact: I've lived in 4 different countries. I'm currently hanging-out in Baja California, Mexico trying to speak better Spanish than my last name would indicate that I do.
