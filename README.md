### Hi there 👋

I'm Natalie, a proudly feminine chica who's all about upendinig the sterotypes of female-coders. I'm partial to creating awesome websites and love working with Jamstack architecture. Netlify and Gatsby are my jam (pun intended!) and Contentful is my go-to headless CMS of choice. I have been working with software teams and managing software product roll-outs for years - all while proudly donning my Louboutins! No reason why one can't be both smart and fashionable! Here are a few of my projects (some public some not). Feel free to reach out to me with questions, collaborations, or anything else tech related. 

Fun Fact: I've lived in 4 different countries. I last spent several years at the southern tip of Baja California, Mexico trying to speak better Spanish than my last name would indicate that I do!
