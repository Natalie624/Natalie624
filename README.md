### Hi there 👋

I'm Natalie, I enjoy creating awesome modern enterprise web properties and applications for large and small businesses. I love using the latest tools and technologies. I specialize in Jamstack architecture using API-first tools and services to deliver scalable and flexible implementations. I have been working with and managing software teams that successfully produce high profile product implementations for nearly two decades - all while proudly donning my Louboutins! No reason why one can't be both smart and fashionable! Here are a few of my projects (some public some not). 

Connect with me: &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliecervantes/"><img height="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Natalie624/Natalie624/main/images/linkedin.png?raw=true"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Fun Fact: I've lived in 4 different countries. I last spent several years at the southern tip of Baja California, Mexico trying to speak better Spanish than my last name would indicate that I do!
